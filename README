producer consumer meets specifications.  It may not be  obvious from
the extended producer/consumer output.  The debug mode and tests 
will output details such as

- when idle proc runs, a series of dots are output in debug mode 
- starting and stopping of idleproc (when sleeping processes awaken)
- processes going to sleep and awaking sleeper processes 
- when process runs off the end, sysstop can be seen to be  invoked
- when new processes are launched using prev indexes, new pids 
	are mod procsize
- receiveany reports the sender pid
- sending to a sender and recving from recvr both report WOULDBLOCK errors
- blocking and unblocking by sender and recvr can be seen 
- message size mismatches are truncated to smaller size buffer
- when a process dies, all waiters are notified and will error 
	out with BADPID from their blocked state
